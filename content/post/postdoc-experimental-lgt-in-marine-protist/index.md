**Postdoctoral Position Available: CRISPR and Experimental Lateral Transfer in a Marine Protist**

The [Collier](https://you.stonybrook.edu/collierlab/) and [Rest](https://phylogenetic.com/) labs at Stony Brook University, in collaboration with the [Archibald lab](http://archibaldlab.ca/) at Dalhousie, invite applications for a postdoctoral position focused on unraveling the complexities of symbiosis using the marine thraustochytrid_ Aurantiochytrium limacinum_. This organism stands out for its intriguing case of lateral transfer of carotenoid biosynthesis genes and provides a fertile ground to study host-virus interactions with _'Mirusviricota'_. This position offers the opportunity to contribute to defining cellular and metabolic factors that influence obligate endosymbioses and the determinants steering successful (endo)symbiont-to-host gene transfer.

The position is located in the [School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.stonybrook.edu/somas/) and [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://www.stonybrook.edu/ecoevo/) at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). Applicants must have previous experience with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques. The goal of the postdoc position is to develop expression vectors and ribonucleoprotein-based approaches for delivering CRISPR gene editing components to _A. limacinum_. Additional goals include utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 editing to generate targeted mutants and working collaboratively with the Archibald lab on naturalistic lateral gene transfer experiments. The project is funded by the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/initiative-strategy-detail?initiativeId=symbiosis-in-aquatic-systems-initiative).

Join us in uncovering new insights into marine microbial eukaryote genetics and symbiosis, while enhancing your research profile in a vibrant, collaborative research environment.
