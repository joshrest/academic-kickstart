We propose to use the evolution of drug-drug interaction scores as a proxy for the evolution of the topology of the underlying biological networks of a bacterial cell. We test this idea by using data from a previous study that measured thousands of these scores for dual drug combinations across species. Mapping biological networks in detail is enormously costly experimentally, while mapping drug-drug interactions is much cheaper and there is evidence that such interactions depend on network topology. Our main result is that drug-drug interactions that are synergistic tend to be closer in  *E. coli* biological networks, and these interactions tend to evolve faster than nodes that are far apart in the network.
