Our paper "Wiring between close nodes in molecular networks evolves more quickly than between distant nodes" has [now been published](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msae098/7676686) as advance access in *Molecular Biology and Evolution*. 
We propose to use the evolution of drug-drug interaction scores as a proxy for the evolution of the topology of the underlying biological networks of a bacterial cell. We test this idea by using data from a previous study that measured thousands of these scores for dual drug combinations across species. Mapping biological networks in detail is enormously costly experimentally, while mapping drug-drug interactions is much cheaper and there is evidence that such interactions depend on network topology. Our main result is that drug-drug interactions that are synergistic tend to be closer in  *E. coli* biological networks, and these interactions tend to evolve faster than nodes that are far apart in the network.
