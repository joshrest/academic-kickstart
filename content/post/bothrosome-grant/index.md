Along with PI Jackie Collier and co-PI Dave Matus, we have recieved a seed grant from the School of Atmospheric and Marine Sciences to study "A unique organelle at the interface of the carbon cycle and marine food webs".
Working in Labyrinthulomycetes, We will identify proteins involved in the production, structure, and regulation of the bothrosome and ectoplasmic network and target the genes encoding these proteins for genetic manipulation by inactivation and tagging. Getting even one target gene will open doors to many additional approaches (immunoprecipitation, etc.).
